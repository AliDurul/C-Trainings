-this is simple 'employee management system-cli'
-in uses a command line for the interface
-it allows admin to add, delete, and edit employees
-it stores the employee list to a file named data.txt
-on the menu:
	use option 1 to add new employees
	use option 2 to modify existing employees
	use option 3 to logout
	use option 4 to quit the program
-thank you
